Copado Deployer v24 - Release Analysis

Key Highlights

Copado Deployer v24 introduces significant improvements in quality gates, user story back-promotion order, pipeline record updates, and bug fixes. The enhancements aim to streamline deployment processes, improve user experience, and ensure consistency.

1. Improved Order of User Stories in Back Promotions

What’s new?

User stories will now be back-promoted in the same order as they were forward-promoted.

Ensures better consistency and predictability in deployments.

This change applies to Salesforce Source Format Pipelines v6.0 and later.

Changes in UI:

The Order User Stories by field on the Promotion record will no longer be used for back promotions.

If using a custom Promotion record layout, the field should be hidden using Lightning App Builder.

Steps to Hide Field:

Navigate to Setup > Lightning App Builder.

Edit the Promotion Record Page.

Find the copado__Order_by__c field component.

Add a visibility rule: Visible only when {!Record.copado__Back_Promotion__c} = false.

Save and activate the page if needed.

2. Quality Tools & Quality Gates Enhancements

Field permissions for the Test field in the Scheduled Jobs object are now included in the Copado User permission set.

If using a cloned Copado User permission set, permissions must be assigned manually.

Steps to Assign Permissions:

Navigate to Setup > Permission Sets.

Select the cloned Copado User permission set.

Go to Object Settings > Scheduled Jobs.

Click Edit, provide Read & Edit permissions, and save.

New Quality Gate UI

Simplified, more efficient configuration experience.

Includes tool-specific guidance for supported tools (e.g., PMD, CRT, Apex).

To use the new experience, install Quality Tools v3.0 and Source Format Pipelines v6.0.

Custom test tools must be updated for compatibility.

Upgrade Instructions for Custom Pages & Permissions:

Update Quality Gate Rule lightning record page.

Update Pipeline lightning record page.

Assign permissions for the new Is Updated Data Model field in the Quality Gate Rule object.

Add new Apex classes to cloned permission sets.

3. Copado Services Documentation

New documentation is now available for:

Persona Domain: Manages credentials and users linked to personas.

User Story Domain: Handles all user story operations.

4. Pipeline UI Enhancements

Rearranged buttons in Pipeline record header for better accessibility.

If using a cloned Pipeline lightning record page, manual updates are needed.

Steps to Update Pipeline UI:

Navigate to Setup > Object Manager > Pipeline.

Click Lightning Record Pages > Edit Cloned Pipeline Record Page.

Arrange buttons in the following order:

Edit

Manage Releases

Pipeline Builder

Initialize

Setup Continuous Delivery

Execute Completed Stories

Find & Replace Rule Editor

Performance Optimizations

Manage Environment Variables

Select Main Branch

Manage Regression Tests

Clone with Environments

Clone

Delete

Add New Filters for Specific Buttons:

Manage Releases: Only visible when Platform = Salesforce.

Pipeline Builder, Initialize, Setup Continuous Delivery, Performance Optimization: Only visible when Platform ≠ Salesforce.

Manage Environment Variables, Setup Regression Tests: Only visible when Platform = Salesforce.

5. Bug Fixes

Salesforce Metadata Pipelines

Fixed an error “Method is not visible: void copado.RunJob.Request.()” when running job templates from Apex.

Issue Resolved: The Request class is now accessible (KI-01013).

Salesforce Source Format Pipelines

Replaced Platform Event Subscriptions with a Polling Mechanism.

Eliminates event subscription limits.

Prevents transition errors from Metadata Pipelines to Source Format Pipelines (KI-01018).

Conclusion

Back Promotions: Now follow forward-promotion order, ensuring accuracy.

Quality Tools & Gates: Simplified UI and required manual updates for custom permission sets.

Pipeline Enhancements: Better button arrangement for ease of access.

Bug Fixes: Addressed critical pipeline and Apex execution issues.

Action Required:

Install Quality Tools v3.0 and Source Format Pipelines v6.0 for new quality gate UI.

Update custom Quality Gate Rule and Pipeline lightning pages if using cloned versions.

Assign permissions for new fields if using cloned permission sets.

These improvements ensure a more efficient, predictable, and seamless deployment process for Copado users.
