### **Bug Fixes**
#### **Issue: Automated Forward Promotions in Metadata Pipelines (KI-01008)**
- **Problem:** Forward promotions were not progressing as expected beyond the first environment.
- **Fix:** Automated promotions now work properly across all configured environments.
- **Impact:** Users with automated pipelines will now see correct deployments.

##### **Issue Details**
- Previously, if a pipeline was set to auto-promote across multiple environments, it stopped after the first promotion.
- Now, the system correctly promotes user stories through all environments as configured.

##### **Example of the Fixed Issue**
If a pipeline is configured as:
**Dev1 → INT → UAT → Prod** (with auto-promotion enabled),
- Before: Promotion would stop after **Dev1 → INT**.
- Now: Promotion will correctly proceed from **Dev1 → INT → UAT → Prod**.

##### **Steps to Reproduce the Issue (Before Fix)**
1. Configure automated forward promotions across multiple environments.
2. Create and commit a user story.
3. Click **Submit**.
4. Previously, only the first promotion happened; no further promotions occurred.
