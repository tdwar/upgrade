Metadata Pipeline Updates

1. Data Commit Access for Copado User-Licensed Users

Before:

Only Copado Admin users could perform Data Commits.

Now:

Copado User-licensed users can also perform Data Commits in user stories using the Metadata format pipeline.

Benefit:

More users can now commit data without needing admin access.

2. Restricting Filter Modifications in Data Commit

Before:

Any user could modify filters in Data Commit.

Now:

Users need a special permission called Edit Filter Data Template Task (API Name: Edit_Filter_Data_Template_Task) to add or modify filters.

If a user doesn’t have permission:

A banner will appear notifying them about the missing permission.

Filters will be shown in read-only mode.

Benefit:

Ensures only authorized users can make changes to data filters, improving security and control.
