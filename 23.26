Metadata Pipeline Updates

1. Data Commit Access for Copado User-Licensed Users

Before:

Only Copado Admin users could perform Data Commits.

Now:

Copado User-licensed users can also perform Data Commits in user stories using the Metadata format pipeline.

Benefit:

More users can now commit data without needing admin access.

2. Restricting Filter Modifications in Data Commit

Before:

Any user could modify filters in Data Commit.

Now:

Users need a special permission called Edit Filter Data Template Task (API Name: Edit_Filter_Data_Template_Task) to add or modify filters.

If a user doesn’t have permission:

A banner will appear notifying them about the missing permission.

Filters will be shown in read-only mode.

Benefit:

Ensures only authorized users can make changes to data filters, improving security and control.

Bug Fixes in v23.26

1. Metadata Rollback Issue

Issue:

Users faced an error (gitPromotion.zip file is not a function) when rolling back metadata, which disrupted deployments.

Fix:

This error has been resolved, and rollback functionality now works correctly.

Benefit:

Users can perform metadata rollbacks without issues.

2. Disappearing Test Class Names in Metadata Grid

Issue:

When using the Add Test Classes button, test class names would disappear automatically.

Fix:

Now, test class names remain visible after selection.

Benefit:

Users can successfully add and select test classes without losing them.

3. Compliance Rules Node Selection Issue

Issue:

Users were limited to selecting only one node per metadata type.

Fix:

Now, users can select multiple nodes without needing to reset the selection.

Benefit:

Improved flexibility in selecting metadata nodes, similar to Salesforce Source Format Pipelines.

4. Non-Admin Users Deploying to Production

Issue:

Users with Copado User licenses (not Admins) were able to deploy directly to Production when they should have been restricted to Sandboxes.

Fix:

Now, Copado correctly blocks Production deployments for these users.

Benefit:

Ensures proper access control and compliance with deployment policies.

Known Issue in v23.26 (KI-00967)

Problem:

Some users with Copado User licenses could still deploy to Production under certain conditions.

Current Status:

This issue has been fixed in the current release.

Scenarios Where the Issue Occurred:

If an Admin validated a deployment before moving to Production, a Copado User could later Merge and Deploy to Production.

If an Admin created a deployment but encountered merge conflicts, a Copado User resolving the conflicts could deploy to Production.

Fix:

Copado now fully prevents Copado User-licensed users from deploying to Production.

Conclusion

Copado Deployer v23.26 makes important improvements and fixes. Now, users can:

Deploy metadata more efficiently.

Experience faster performance in deployments.

Select metadata fields without issues.

Perform Data Commits with more control and security.

Avoid deployment errors and unexpected access issues.

A previous issue where non-admin users could deploy to Production has now been resolved. Overall, this update makes deployments easier and more reliable.
